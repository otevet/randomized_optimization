To run the code, clone the repo from:

https://github.com/otevet/CS-7641/tree/main/randomized_optimization

Install the following required Python 3 packages:
pandas
- mlrose-hiive == 2.2.3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Sklearn

For part 1, run the following files to create the problems and associated files. 

1. The Flip Flop problem code can be run by 'python flip_flop.py' 

2. The Continuous Peaks problem code can be run as: 'python continuous_peaks.py'

3. The Knapsack problem code can be run by running 'python knapsack.py' 

For part 2, the ML Weight Optimization problem code with all 4 algorithms can be found in the 'nn_weight_optimization.ipynb' file

The dataset for part 2 (NN weight optimization) is provided as Pickle files (X2.pkl, y2.pkl)

Generating the graphs can be done with the respective Jupyter notebook files.
